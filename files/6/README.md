Q1:
1.int element is unneessary since element is never used;
2.Number of values to read from the input can't be an constant.If the vector elements has less than 10 items, error will occur;

To modify, if the function means to change the first 10 elements to 0; the answer is in q.cc
if the function means to change every elements to 0,delete all the code except i = 0;

Q2.
can't define (*a) = 12 directly since it's an address.
The modification is in q.cc

Q3.
I think there's nothing wrong with it.

Q4.
For the second part, the value of a and b is defined again, so the result will be 3 again 
this makes the second part meaningless but the code can still run so i think that's ok.


Q5.
The loop will never end since the value of i will always be 0 and -1
The modification is in q.cc

Q6.
